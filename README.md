 DESCRIPTION -The Rock-Paper-Scissors GUI application is a straightforward yet engaging desktop game built using Java Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI). This project aims to recreate the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game with an intuitive and user-friendly design, allowing players to compete against the computer in an interactive environment. The game is designed to demonstrate basic GUI development skills and the seamless integration of frontend and backend components.

** *Features:

User-Friendly Interface: The application boasts a simple and easy-to-navigate interface, making it accessible to users of all ages.

Score Tracking: Both player and computer scores are tracked and displayed in real-time, providing immediate feedback on the game's progress.

Random Computer Moves: The computer selects its moves (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) randomly to ensure fair and unpredictable gameplay.

Interactive Elements: Players can make their moves by clicking on buttons, with immediate visual and textual feedback on the results.

Visual Feedback: The application provides clear visual feedback through labels and borders, enhancing the overall user experience.

***Technical Details:

****Programming Language: Java

***GUI Framework: Java Swing

***Components: JFrame, JLabel, JButton, Font, BorderFactory

***Event Handling: Utilizes ActionListeners to manage user inputs and game logic

Thread Management: Uses SwingUtilities.invokeLater() to run the GUI on the Event Dispatch Thread, ensuring smooth and responsive performance.

***Project Structure:

***Backend (App.java): Handles the main application logic, including initializing and managing the GUI.

***Frontend (RockPaperScissorsGUI.java): Manages the graphical user interface, including layout, components, and event handling.

How to Play:

Launch the application.

The game window displays the initial scores for both the player and the computer.

The computer's move is randomly generated and displayed.

View the result of the round and see the updated scores.

Continue playing to improve your score and enjoy the game.

This Rock-Paper-Scissors GUI application is an excellent project for learning and practicing Java programming and GUI development skills. It offers both entertainment and educational value, making it a great addition to any developer's portfolio.
